# openGemini-operator

## Description
Cloud Native Installation and Deployment of [opengemini](https://github.com/openGemini/openGemini) database using K8S.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install helm:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

2. Add chart repo:

```
helm repo add opengemini https://opengemini.github.io/openGemini-operator
```

3. Install chart(both CRDs and operator) in specified namespace:

```
kubectl create ns opengemini-system
helm install opengemini-operator opengemini/operator -n opengemini-system
```

4. Deploy cluster in specified namespace, you can copy [example configuration file](config/samples/_v1_opengeminicluster.yaml) to local path and modify it:

```
kubectl create ns opengemini
kubectl -n opengemini create -f config/samples/_v1_opengeminicluster.yaml
```

5. Uninstall chart:

```
helm uninstall opengemini-operator -n opengemini-system
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
